I’m a problem-solver. Whether a magazine spread requires a minimalist approach or a poster needs bold, innovative flair, I come up with A+ designs while adding a touch of my own personality. I’m a New Jersey-based designer pursuing a Bachelor in Fine Arts with a concentration in Graphic & Interactive Design at William Paterson University. Design is my passion, and I am always exploring new venues to develop and refine my craft. Feel free to browse my work, and if you like what you see, let’s keep in touch.
